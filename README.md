## LegoProxy Usage
For example, we want to get Roblox's Roblox Information by his Roblox ID.

From the Roblox API, you would normally create a GET Request from the URL:
```
https://users.roblox.com/v1/users/1
```

But with LegoProxy, You will have to place the Endpoint from the URL path before the API path you want to create a GET Request from:
```
https://legoproxy.deta.dev/users/v1/users/1
```

Requesting to LegoProxy follows the following format:
```
https://legoproxy.deta.dev/<subdomain>/<path>
```

Requesting to LegoProxy follows the following format if you are going to request with a Rotating IP:
```
https://legoproxy.deta.dev/rotate/<subdomain>/<path>
```

## LegoProxy Features
- Access to all Roblox APIs and Endpoints
